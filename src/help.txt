        The path to the mountpoint (REQUIRED)

    --block-size=<block_size_in_kib>:
        The size of the fetched blocks in KiB; a larger block-size increases latency but also increases transfer-speed (DEFAULT: 1MiB)

    --cache-size=<cache_size_in_kib>:
        The cache-size; a larger cache-size increases the required amount of memory but also may lower latency and increase transfer-speed (DEFAULT: 256MiB)

    --timeout=<timeout_in_secs>:
        The time to wait/retry until a filesystem-operation returns `ETIMEDOUT` (DEFAULT: 60s)

    --no-fork:
